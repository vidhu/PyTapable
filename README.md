## :strawberry: About The Project
PyTapable  provides a set of utility to help you implement hookable interfaces in your classes. This opens up the
posibility for solving a number of usecases such as

 - Providing plugable interfaces for your libraries and frameworks
 - Code seperation by functional and service domains

## :sun_with_face: Getting Started
This project can be used in python 2.7, 3.5 and greater

```bash
$ pip install pytapable
```

### Example
#### Inline hooks
We first create our hook called `my_hook`
```python
from pytapable import Hook

my_hook = Hook()
```

As a consumer, we can tap into this hook by passing a name for our tap and a callback function
```python
def my_callback(context, greeting):
    print(f"Hook says: {greeting}")
    
my_hook.tap('My Tap Name', my_callback)
```
Our callback is executed when the `hook.call(...)` is executed. The callback receives whatever args were passed in the
`hook.call` method in addition to a context `dict`
```python
my_hook.call(greeting="Hi Callback")
```

#### Functional Hooks
Functional hooks are different from inline hooks in that the callback args are predefined.
```python
from pytapable import CreateHook, HookableMixin, create_hook_name


class Car(HookableMixin):
    HOOK_ON_MOVE = create_hook_name('on_move')
    
    @CreateHook(name=HOOK_ON_MOVE)
    def move(self, speed=10):
        return f"Moving at {speed} Mph"
```
 - Start adding the `HookableMixin` to the Car Class. This is necessary to install hooks on class methods.
 - Decorate the `Car.move` method using the `@CreateHook` decorator. In the decorator, give it a name. As best practice 
 we define the name as a Class Constant so consumers can easily refer to it.
 - The value of the hook can be anything. We use the `create_hook_name(str)` utility to generate a unique name. 
 Generating a unique name is not required but becomes important when inheriting hooks from other Classes.

```python
def callback(context, fn_args, fn_output):
    kmph_speed = fn_args['speed'] * 1.61
    print(f"The car is moving {kmph_speed} kmph")

c = Car()
c.hooks[Car.HOOK_ON_MOVE].tap('log_metric_speed', callback, before=False)

c.move(10)

```

 - Here we tap into the `on_move` hook which fires our callback after the `c.move` method has executed
 - The `c.move()` arguments are passed as `fn_args` to the callback and return value, if any, is passed as `fn_output`
 - The context holds a `is_before` and `is_after` flag it signify if the callback was executed before or after `c.move()`
